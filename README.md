### PyCray Assessment Dashboard

## Overview

This project involves creating a dashboard for property management. The frontend is built with React.js, and the backend uses Node.js to serve data through a RESTful API. PostgreSQL is used for data storage, while Python is utilized for data fetching and generation. The project aligns with the design provided in the Figma file.


### Technologies

1) Frontend: React.js, Context API/Redux, HTML, CSS (for UI responsiveness)
2) Backend: Node.js, Express.js (RESTful API)
3) Database: PostgreSQL
4) Data Fetching: Python
5) Other: Figma (UI Design Reference)

### Running the Application
 Backend: Set up the Node.js server as described above. 
`node index.js`
 Frontend: Set up the React.js application as described. 
 `npm run start`
Database: Set up PostgreSQL with the provided schema and data. 
Data Fetching: Run the Python script to generate data. 
`python fetch_data.py `
Once everything is set up, the application should be running on http://localhost:3001 (for frontend) and http://localhost:3000 (for backend).
